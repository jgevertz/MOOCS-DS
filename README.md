Multi-Objective Optimization of Combination Synergy - Dose Selection Algorithm
Data and code associated with "Guiding model-driven combination dose selection using multi-objective synergy optimization"
- All paper results related to the toy modelare found by running MOOCS_DS_ToyModel.m in the ToyModel directory. Note you do need a version of MATLAB that can run a script for which the function files are embedded in the main m-file. If your version of MATLAB does not allow this, each function file needs to be put into its own .m file in the same directory and appropriately named.
